# i2c-sniffer-100kBaud-Arduino-Mega

This Arduino Mega sketch uses direct port read and bit manipulations
to sniff an i2c bus running at up to 100 kHz

The raw state transitions and the analysis of the i2c communication is displayed
on the Serial monitor

A sample output https://github.com/rricharz/i2c-sniffer-100kBaud-Arduino-Mega/master/sniffer.txt is enclosed, showing successful and failing i2c transfers.
